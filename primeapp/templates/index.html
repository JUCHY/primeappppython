    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    Uses the Miller Rabin Probability test and hence trades accuracy for computation speed
    <br>Contains 3 steps:
    <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Find n-1 = 2<sup>k</sup> * m, where n chosen number, and k and m are random integers. We start by dividing the number by 2<sup>1</sup>, then 2<sup>2</sup>, onward, until we find a number 2<sup>k</sup> that n-1 is not divisible by.
            Then we take the k, and m, from the previous number and send that to step 2.</li>
            <li>Step 2: We find an a where 1 < a < n-1. For this program, we used to as our a in all cases. With that we calculate 2<sup>m</sup>mod n,
            and that is sent to the last step</li>
            <li>Step 3: The program in its first iteration checks if 2<sup>m</sup>mod n is equal to 1 or -1, if  it is not, 2<sup>m</sup> is squared
            then the program checks if (2<sup>m</sup>)<sup>2</sup>>mod n is equal to -1. If equal to -1, the number is a prime, if equal to 1, it is not prime.
          if it is neither, the recursion goes on until it is either 1 or -1, or it hits its 100th iteration, therein the program decides that it is composite</li>
     </ul>
